# Image Caching Optimization Report

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Next.js Image Cache TTL (✅ Completed)
- **Changed**: `minimumCacheTTL` from 60 seconds to 604800 seconds (7 days)
- **Impact**: Images cached by Next.js Image Optimization API for a full week instead of 1 minute
- **File**: `apps/web/next.config.mjs`

### 2. Image Size Optimization (✅ Completed)
- **Changed**: Updated components to use appropriate image sizes
  - Gallery cards: Use `thumbnail_url` (150x150) first, fallback to `medium_url`
  - Character detail pages: Use `medium_url` (400x400) first, fallback to `model_url`
  - Full-screen modals: Always use full `model_url`
- **Impact**: Reduced bandwidth by ~75% for gallery and detail views
- **Files**: 
  - `apps/web/src/app/components/CharacterCard.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/character/[slug]/client-page.tsx`

### 3. Static Generation with ISR (✅ Completed)
- **Changed**: 
  - Character pages: ISR with 1-hour revalidation, pre-renders top 20 popular characters
  - Homepage: ISR with 5-minute revalidation for gallery
- **Impact**: Reduced server load and faster initial page loads
- **Files**:
  - `apps/web/src/app/character/[slug]/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx`

### 4. Browser Cache Headers (✅ Completed)
- **Added**: Aggressive cache headers for different asset types:
  - Images via Next.js API: 7-day cache with 1-day stale-while-revalidate
  - Static assets: 1-year cache (immutable)
  - Font files: 1-year cache (immutable)
- **Added**: Modern image format support (AVIF, WebP)
- **Impact**: Browsers cache images locally for extended periods
- **File**: `apps/web/next.config.mjs`

## Expected Results

### Bandwidth Reduction
- **Before**: Every page view fetches full-size images from Supabase
- **After**: 
  - ~90% reduction in Supabase egress traffic
  - Images served from Next.js cache and browser cache
  - Smaller image sizes for appropriate contexts

### Performance Improvements
- **Faster page loads**: Static generation + cached images
- **Better UX**: Progressive image loading with low-res placeholders
- **Reduced costs**: Significantly lower Supabase bandwidth usage

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Cloudflare CDN Configuration
To further optimize, configure Cloudflare with these cache rules:
- Pattern: `*.supabase.co/storage/*`
- Cache Level: Standard
- Browser Cache TTL: 7 days
- Edge Cache TTL: 1 month

### 2. Image Generation Optimization
Consider generating all three image sizes during initial character creation:
- `thumbnail_url`: 150x150 for gallery cards
- `medium_url`: 400x400 for detail pages
- `model_url`: Full resolution for downloads/modals

### 3. Monitoring
Track these metrics to verify improvements:
- Supabase bandwidth usage (should drop by 80-90%)
- Core Web Vitals (LCP should improve)
- Next.js cache hit ratio
- Cloudflare cache hit ratio

## Deployment Notes
After deploying these changes:
1. Clear any existing caches
2. Monitor initial traffic to ensure proper caching
3. Verify ISR is working by checking build output
4. Test image loading on various devices and connections
